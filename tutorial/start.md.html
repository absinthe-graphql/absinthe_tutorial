<h1 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h1>
<p>We'll be building a very basic GraphQL API for a blog, written in Elixir using Absinthe.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Before you start, it's a good idea to have some background into GraphQL in general. Here are a few resources that might be helpful:</p>
<ul>
<li>The official <a href="http://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a> website</li>
<li><a href="https://www.howtographql.com/">How to GraphQL</a> (this includes another <a href="https://www.howtographql.com/graphql-elixir/0-introduction/">brief tutorial</a> using Absinthe)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-example">The Example</h2>
<p>The tutorial expects you to have a properly set-up <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/installation.html">Phoenix application</a> with <a href="https://hex.pm/packages/absinthe">absinthe</a> and <a href="https://hex.pm/packages/absinthe_plug">absinthe_plug</a> added to the dependencies.</p>

<p>If you'd like to cheat, you can find the finished code for the tutorial in the <a href="https://github.com/absinthe-graphql/absinthe_tutorial">Absinthe Example</a> project on GitHub.</p>
