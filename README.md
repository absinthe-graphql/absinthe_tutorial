# Absinthe Tutorial Code

This repository houses the example code for the official Absinthe tutorial
that ships with [Absinthe's documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/absinthe).

It currently targets:

- Absinthe v1.4
- Phoenix v1.3

## Contributing/Scope

Note the tutorial's target audience are beginners and the scope is
currently limited to queries, mutations, and basic schema definitions.

Contributions of additional features (e.g., subscriptions, more complex types, file uploads, etc)
should:

- Still keep beginners in mind.
- Be linked to a PR in the [absinthe](https://github.com/absinthe-graphql/absinthe) project
  contributing a draft of accompanying text---as a believable expansion of the tutorial
  narrative.
